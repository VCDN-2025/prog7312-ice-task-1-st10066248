How the Game Works:

    Setup:

        The game selects a random animal name from a predefined list

        You start with 5 guesses and 0 points

    Gameplay:

        For each guess:

            Correct guess: +10 points, game ends in victory

            Wrong guess: -1 point, shows the first letter as a hint

        Game ends when you guess correctly or run out of guesses

    Features Implemented:

        Score System: Tracks points (+10/-1) using variables

        Guess Limit: 5 guesses max using a while loop

        Hint System: Shows first letter after wrong guess using string operations

    Bonus:

        I added a simple leaderboard that keeps track of top 5 scores (using a List)

        Option to play multiple rounds
